### The Air Force Song: 
(Only first verse is required per the FTM) 

Off we go into the wild blue yonder, 
Climbing high into the sun; 
Here they come zooming to meet our thunder, 
At 'em now, Give 'em the gun! (Give 'em the gun hey!) 
Down we dive, spouting our flame from under, 
Off with one helluva roar! 
We live in fame or go down in flame.  
Hey! Nothing'll stop the U.S. Air Force! 
 
Brilliant minds fashioned a crate of thunder  
Sent it high into the blue  
Valiant hands blasted the world asunder,  
How they lived God only knew!  
Boundless souls dreaming of skies to conquer  
Gave us wings ever to soar,  
With scouts before and bombers galore, Hey! 
Nothing'll stop the US Air Force!  
 
Here's a toast to the host of those  
Who love the vastness of the sky,  
To a friend we send a message 
of the brave who serve on high.  
We drink to those who gave their all of old,  
Then down we roar  
to score the rainbow's pot of gold.  
A toast to the host of those we boast, the US Air Force.  
 
Off we go into the wild sky yonder,  
Keep the wings level and true!  
If you'd live to be a grey–haired wonder,  
Keep the nose out of the blue!  
Fly to fight, guarding the nation's border,  
We'll be there, followed by more,  
In echelon we carry on! Hey!  

Nothing'll stop the US Air Force!  
– Robert MacArthur Crawford (original) 

## The Armed Forces Code of Conduct: 
I. I am an American, fighting in the forces which guard my country and our way of life. I am prepared to give my life in their defense. 

II. I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never surrender the members of my command while they still have the means to resist. 
 
III. If I am captured, I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make every effort to escape and aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy. 

IV. If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give no information nor take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am senior I will take command. If not I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed over me and back them up in every way. 

V. When questioned, should I become a prisoner of war, I am required to give name, rank, service number, and date of birth. I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability. I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies or harmful to their cause. 

VI. I will never forget that I am an American, fighting for freedom, responsible for my actions, and dedicated to the principles which made my country free. I will trust in my God and in the United States of America. 

### Quotes: 

Integrity is the fundamental premise for military service in a free society. Without integrity, the moral pillars of our military strength, public trust, and self-respect are lost. 

-General Charles A. Gabriel, Chief of Staff, USAF 

 
Discipline. Equals. Freedom. 

-Jocko Willink, USN SEALs 

 
Success is not final; failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts. 

 
-Sir Winston Churchill 

 
If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining…you can endure anything your mind can make endurable. 

-Marcus Aurelius 

 
If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader. 

-John Quincy Adams, sixth President of the United States 

 
Servant leadership…It’s the notion of being part of something bigger than yourself and of making the people around you better. In our daily struggles to advance within an organization, we sometimes forget that it’s actually more about…the people that are around us. 

-General Lori J. Robertson, USAF 

 
Treating EVERY Airman with dignity and respect must be at the heart of who we are and how we operate…Every single person around you brings something to the fight that you don’t. Each of them is critically important to mission success… 

-General Mark A. Welsh III, Chief of Staff, USAF 

 
In every battle, there comes a time when both sides consider themselves beaten; then he who continues the attack wins. 

-General Ulysses S. Grant, USA 

Victory smiles upon those who anticipate the changes in the character of war, not upon those who wait to adapt themselves after the changes occur. 

-Italian Air Marshall Giulio Douhet 

 
In the long haul, our safety as a nation may depend upon achieving space superiority. 

-General Bernard Schriever, USAF 

The Cadet Honor Code: 

We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does. 

Lying: is any statement of untruth or omission of the truth, which is meant to deceive or mislead. One example of lying at FT is intentionally signing in at an improper time in order to avoid a regulation violation. 

Stealing: Anyone who wrongfully takes, obtains, or withholds someone else's property without their permission, with the intent to temporarily or permanently deprive another of such property, is guilty of stealing.  

Cheating: In essence, cheating is taking unfair advantage of another. Cheating violates the competitive sense of "fair play." An example of cheating at FT is not completing the minimum required push-ups during the Fitness Assessment, yet coercing your spotter to indicate otherwise or knowingly allow it to occur.  

Toleration: means the conditional acceptance of, or non-interference of, wrong-doings. If you know a cadet has lied, stolen, or cheated, and you fail to report or confront the matter, you may be guilty of toleration.  

Air Force Core Values: 

Integrity First.  Service Before Self.  Excellence in All We Do. 

Integrity First: Integrity is acting in a manner that is consistent and uncompromised to a set of principles in both professional and 19 private spheres of life. Persons of integrity do not make choices based on what is popular or most advantageous to themselves but rather on what most closely aligns to the posterity of their internalized principles.  

Service Before Self: The first three words of the U.S. Constitution, for which military members swear (or affirm) to support and defend are these: “We the People”. People are the most critical asset to national defense, and the very reason for which military members serve. To serve selflessly resists the natural tendency to focus on self-interests and, therefore, do not take advantage of situations for personal gain, pleasure, or safety. Unity and cohesiveness is generated where there is a willingness to share in the danger, hardships, and discomforts in order to promote common welfare of a group.  

Excellence in All We Do: To remain the world’s preeminent air force, Airmen make a lifelong commitment to developing a sustained passion for continuous improvement and innovation. Persons of excellence continuously venture outside their comfort zones and seek out ways to expand their knowledge and experience. These individuals welcome feedback and constructive criticism, and are not afraid to recognize their weaknesses and find ways to mitigate them. They base their self-esteem and sense of accomplishment not on how they compare with others but on the magnitude and longevity of their actions’ impact. 

Additional Quotes: 

War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling, which thinks that nothing is worth war, is much worse. The person, who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. 

 -John Stuart Mill 

The troops I have commanded have always been well dressed, been smart saluters, been prompt and bold in action because I have personally set the example…The influence one man can have on thousands is a never-ending source of wonder to me. You are always on parade.  

-General George S. Patton, USA 

An army marches on its stomach 

 -Napoleon Bonaparte 

It is the soldier, not the reporter, who has given us the freedom of the press. It is the soldier, not the poet, who has given us the freedom of speech. It is the soldier, not the campus organizer, who has given us the freedom to demonstrate. It is the soldier who salutes the flag, who serves beneath the flag, and whose coffin is draped by the flag, who allows the protestor to burn the flag. 

-Father Denis E. O’Brien, Sergeant, USMC 

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. 

-Theodore Roosevelt, 26th President of United States

Bed Guidelines:

Keep bed rails clean and free from dust. Cadets will sleep with their 

head to the wall (aka head end of bed). The bottom bunks will be utilized 

prior to the top bunks. Two cadets will be housed per room and both 

sides of the bed will be considered subject to inspection. 

a. The bed will be made as follows: 

(1) Mattress. Center the mattress on the bed frame and ground 

to the head end of bed. 

(2) Bottom Sheet. Drape evenly over width of mattress. Ensure 

bottom edge of sheet is flush with the foot end of mattress. 

Tuck excess sheet under the head end of mattress. Make 

hospital corners. 

NOTE: Making hospital corners. First, grasp the side of sheet 

approximately 12 inches from the head end of mattress; then, lay the 

sheet on top of the mattress, creating a 45-degree angle. Tuck excess 

hanging down, under mattress. Next grasp 45-degree angle and without 

changing its shape, bring it down and tuck under mattress. After sheet 

is completely tucked, smooth and tighten to the conformity of mattress. 

(3) Top Sheet. Drape evenly over width of mattress so that the 

top edge of the sheet is approximately 12 inches from the 

head end of the mattress. Tuck excess under the foot end of 

mattress. 

(4) Blanket. Drape evenly over width of mattress so that the top 

edge of the blanket is approximately 12 inches from the head 

end of the mattress. Tuck the excess blanket under the foot 

end of mattress. Make hospital corners with both the sheet 

and the blanket, together. 

(5) Pillow and Pillowcase. Put pillow inside the case and place 

on the bed, open side to the right with excess material neatly 

folded underneath, flush with the head of the bed, and 

centered with the width of the mattress. 

(6) Cadets will display an AETC Form 341, with the top portion 

prefilled, centered on and under the pillow with only the 

completed portion of the form visible.

Shoe Display 

Keep all shoes clean, dry, shined, serviceable, and displayed where 

applicable. If an item becomes unserviceable, notify your FTO or CTA. 

Tightly lace all shoes/boots not being used. “Tightly laced” shoelaces 

will be pulled closed as tightly as possible without being tied. Loosely 

lace one pair of running shoes prior to lights out. “Loosely laced” shoes 

allow you to easily slide your foot into the shoe in case of emergency. 

Tuck excess laces inside the shoes, out of sight. 

 

a. Combat Boots with Loops. Make a bar at the bottom of the boot 

by lacing from the outside to the inside through the bottom 

eyelets. Continue lacing the boot from the inside to the outside 

until you get to the second eyelet from the top. Make an “X” at 

the top by lacing the top eyelets from outside to the inside. 

Tighten the laces. Tie a single knot at the end of the laces. Tuck 

the excess laces inside the boot out of sight. NOTE: If your boots 

have loops instead of eyelets, lace boots with a bar at the bottom 

by inserting the laces from bottom to top of the loops and continue 

lacing the entire boot in this manner. 

Boot Photo 1

Running Shoes. Lace in the same manner as low quarters unless 

your running shoes have loops. In this case, lace in the same 

manner as boots with loops. 

Dinning Facility (DFAC) 

General Information  

The Dining Facility (DFAC) serves a nutritious, balanced diet designed for active cadets. Cadets are encouraged to eat three meals daily. Cadets who choose not to eat are still required to process through the DFAC with the flight. Use courtesy and etiquette when requesting items from the personnel at the serving line. Food will not be taken from the DFAC, unless authorized by the FTU/CC. Cadets are expected to render proper customs and courtesies at all times. The scheduling of the DFAC is on a tight timeline. Early or late arrival may cause disruption to the schedule and therefore should be avoided.  

During each meal period selected cadets will be designated as water monitors. Upon arriving at the DFAC, these cadets will request permission to be excused for water monitor duty, leave their flight, and proceed to the kitchen to begin filling glasses of water for the cadets in the serving line. Once the current water monitor is relieved of duty by the in-coming water monitor, he or she will immediately process through the serving line as quickly as possible.  

 When Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) or box meals are used, cadets will not consume candy, mints, or caffeinated products unless authorized by the FTU/CC. No items may be kept once the meal period ends. Do not leave any garbage and/or unopened items behind - clean up after yourself.  

Entrance Procedures  

Flights do not enter the DFAC until directed by an FTU member. The on-duty mess checkers have the authority to clear flights into the DFAC early/late if there are no other flights waiting and the early/late flight will not inhibit any other flight’s on-time entry into the facility. The Cadet Group staff will verify dining priorities with the FTU/DOS at least one day in advance.  

All flights will use the following procedures to access the DFAC:  

Flights will arrive no more than 3 minutes before or after their scheduled dining priorities. The Cadet Flt/CC will note the time they initially halt the flight in front of the dining hall as their official arrival time. For example, if a flight has to wait for another flight to clear the bay area, they will still annotate their initial halting time as their official arrival time. Cadet Flt/CCs are responsible for coordinating with other Cadet Flt/CCs awaiting entry to ensure they do not skip or make another flight late by arriving out of their 6-minute arrival window.  

The Cadet Flt/CC is responsible for checking in with mess checker. They halt the flight, place them at parade rest, and then take the most direct and unobstructed route to within no closer than six feet in front of the mess checker, halt, initiate a salute and say, "Sir/Ma'am, ___ Flight reports. Our accountability is __ of __." The mess checker returns the salute and either clears the flight to enter or directs the Cadet Flt/CC to standby. Once permitted to enter, the Cadet Flt/CC will ask, "Will that be all, Sir/Ma'am?" salute, return to the flight, and direct the flight to enter the dining facility with normal building entrance procedures. If the flight arrives late/early the mess checker should discuss the issue with either the Flt CTA or FTO to determine the cause. The mess checker should relay trends of late/early arrivals to the operation center to prevent recurring issues.  

The mess checker and cadet reporting-in do not need to interrupt their reporting procedures to greet and salute commissioned staff. The area outside the dining hall will only be called to attention for colonels (O-6) and above. The first cadet to see one of these officers will call the area to attention, salute the officer(s), and render the greeting of the day. When the officer returns the salute the cadet will drop their salute and direct the area to carry on. When other commissioned officers approach, formation leaders will come to attention and call their formations to attention before rendering salutes.  

Cadets must wash their hands, or at a minimum use hand sanitizer, prior to entering the DFAC.  

Dining Facility Procedures  

While moving throughout the DFAC, cadets will limit talking to only de-conflicting movements (e.g. “excuse me”) and providing necessary responses to FTU or dining facility staff. Cadets may pass each other in the serving area if they are not waiting for the same food items. Cadets must execute proper situational awareness to ensure that they do not run into or obstruct the path of one another while moving through the dining facility. (NOTE: Cadets will not square corners while carrying trays, but will square corners in non-carpeted areas if unencumbered). The Cadet Flt/CD will be the first to process through the chow line, and the Cadet Flt/CC will be the last.  

If a cadet needs to use the restroom, they will proceed directly to the restroom once they’ve entered the DFAC. Upon exiting the restroom, rejoin the line.  

Do not perform facing movements while in the serving line or while carrying a tray. You will sidestep through the entire serving line (heels together when halted). All cadets should select (and consume) three full 8 ounce glasses of drinking water or sports drink per meal (24 total ounces).  

The following guidelines apply whether or not a cadet is eating.  

 Cadets will be seated IAW additional guidance provided by the FTU staff.  

 Once halted in position, cadets will center and ground their tray to the front edge of the table, and the stand in the position of attention. Cadets will remain at attention until the table is filled or a reasonable amount of time (~20 seconds) has passed. The last cadet to arrive will stand at attention and give the command, “Be seated.”  

 Other items carried by cadets that are not needed for eating (e.g. hydration systems, ponchos, etc.) will be secured under their chairs. Once seated, cadets in positions 2 and 3 will pass a napkin to cadets in positions 1 and 4 and then take one for themselves. Each cadet will place their napkin on their lap.  

 Cadets will sit at modified attention with back straight (not resting on the chair back) and shoulders squared. Elbows will not be placed on the table or chair arms. Cadets may bend forward at the waist and look down while eating to prevent spilling food.  

Cadets will not converse with one another at the table. If a cadet wishes to reach a condiment (salt, pepper, etc.) he or she will state, “Pardon my reach”. If the item is outside of the cadet’s reach, another cadet at the table will assist passing the item to the first cadet. Additionally, cadets may answer questions which are directed to them by staff or dining facility personnel.  

The last cadet to have arrived will state, “Moment of silence” (to accommodate those who wish to pray before their meal). When everyone at the table is ready, the same cadet will state “Enjoy your meal.”  

Cadets have 10 minutes to eat their meal. Time begins when, “Enjoy your meal” is stated and ends when trays are removed from the table. The cadet that is timing the meal will place his or her watch on the center of table once started.  

 Cadets will place a napkin on top of the tray to signify they are finished with the meal.  

Once everyone at the table has finished eating (all occupants of the table have napkins on their tray), cadets in positions 2 and 3 will pass all the items from their trays to cadets in positions 1 and 4. Glasses will be placed on the trays upside down, but will not be stacked. Trays will be stacked and carried to the cabinets by two when possible. If there are three cadets, one cadet will carry his/her own tray. If a cadet is unable to carry the tray due to restrictions, the other cadets will make the appropriate adjustments to carry the tray. Once trays are stacked, cadets will stand, don their hydration systems, ground the chairs to the right side of the table, and then momentarily assume the position of attention. The cadet in position 1 will proceed to the tray cabinet. The cadet in position 3 will lift the napkin holder while the cadet in position 2 wipes down the table. The cadet in position 4 will wait to collect any waste left over from cleaning and then proceed to the tray cabinet. Trays will be placed in the cabinet from bottom to top, back to front. After complete position duties, cadets will proceed to the exit in a military manner.  

 Departure Procedures  

Upon exiting, cadets will form details and transit to the flight's designated form-up location. Once the guidon has been retrieved and five or more cadets have arrived at the form up location, the cadet flight commander, or a designated representative, will give the command, "FALL IN". Cadets will be in a detail or flight and at the position of attention or parade rest at all times. Cadets will not talk unless making on-the-spot corrections.
