## CHAPTER 6 – EVALUATION AND DISCIPLINE
### Evaluation
Both GMC and POC will be evaluated twice during the Fall 2022 term using the Air Force Form 724 (Airman Comprehensive Assessment Worksheet). The AF Form 724 will continue to be exposed to both GMC and POC for education during feedback, but only POC will receive a physical rating in their position on the AF Form 724.

Supervisors will be required to meet individually with each cadet subordinate to review and discuss the performance evaluation. In addition, the superior will use continuous written and verbal communication to provide feedback. The CW/CV will ensure standardized execution of staff level demonstrations of proper rating techniques IAW AS300 instructional materials and the CW/CC vision. The initial and final feedback sessions will occur as follows:

For both GMC and POC, initial expectations and feedback must be completed before LLAB #4 (27 September 2022). End of term feedback must be completed before LLAB #12 (29 November 2022).
