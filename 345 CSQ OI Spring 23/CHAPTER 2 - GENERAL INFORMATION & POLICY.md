### Detachment 345 Cadet Communication
The Cadet Squadron MS Teams page has source documents pertinent to your success in this class. It can be found here: [https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3axT2oLqa5SflJVRQhdmP2ndaYvFH3lKZzm2hNTG\_8pn41%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=cb726f59-dd8a-4a54-93e5-5fd00b88824e&tenantId=4c25b8a6-17f7-46f9-83f0-54734ab81fb1][1]

### Policies
Outlined below are various Cadet Wing policies to be implemented throughout the Fall 2022 semester. The intention for these policies is to clearly covey expectations for the Cadet Wing as a whole, and to serve as a quick reference for all cadets.

IAW AFROTCI 36-2011V3, para 9.10.1, “cadets and participating students must achieve at least 80% attendance over the course of the term to pass each of the following: AS Class, LLAB, and PT. All absences will initially be categorized as unexcused and will count against the 80% attendance requirement. At the discretion of the primary instructor, the absence may be marked as excused after the cadet completes missed objectives. Excused absences will count towards meeting the 80% attendance requirement.”

Attendance at mandatory Practical Military Training events is the expected norm. Absence is considered irregular and highly infrequent. Excusal from mandatory PMT will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the OFC.

Regular attendance is also expected for POC at events in addition to PMT. Such events may include, but are not limited to, weekly meetings for all POC that take place before and after PMT, Cadre meetings for members of CW leadership, and meetings for all POC following AS300 and AS400 class.

Detachment 345 has a zero-tolerance policy on sexual harassment and assault, drug abuse, underage drinking, mal-training, and discrimination of any kind. If a cadet would like to report on one of these issues, there are four courses of action one may take:
   - Follow their respective chain of command, informing their direct supervisor.
   - “Jump” their chain of command and inform their superior’s superior, or any other cadet higher in the chain of command or go directly to the Cadre.
   - Go directly to the Cadet Wing Inspector General.
   - Utilize the Commander’s Action Line.
	 - The Commander’s Action Line is an anonymous reporting tool for issues of mal-training, mal-treatment, hazing, unprofessional relations, or any other serious concerns that are shared directly with the Detachment Commander. The form is For Official Use Only (FOUO) and can be accessed via the Detachment 345 Teams.

Cadets with exemplary Physical Fitness Assessment scores will be granted “PT Passes” on a sliding scale. The pass may be used at the cadet’s discretion to excuse them from one PT session without counting against their total attendance. The cadet must inform their chain of command NLT 24 hours prior to its use for proper accountability of all cadets. This number of passes is determined by following scale:
  - ≥ 95 PFA score grants one PT Pass
  - = 100 PFA score grants two PT Passes

#### Civil Involvements
While in the AFROTC program, you should respect all civil, military, and school policies and refrain from behavior that leads to being cited or charged by civil, military, or school agencies. Any offense, violation of law or ordinance, or any other incident causing adverse involvement or contact with civil, military, or school authorities as an adult or juvenile is an involvement for AFROTC purposes and must be reported in WINGS. If you are involved in an incident, you must report the adverse involvement to cadre within 72 hours of the incident. The initial cadre point of contact for civil involvements will be Technical Sergeant Jairzinho Chin.

AFROTC cadets will self-report the Civil Involvement via WINGS at the following link: [https://WINGS.holmcenter.com/psp/hcp/LANDING/PORT\_HCP/h/?tab=HOME][2]

#### Drug Use
During the completion of the AFROTC application, you completed the AFROTC Form 2030 on the United States Air Force Drug and Alcohol Abuse Policy. With this certification, you have been counseled and briefed on the fact that any future use (referred as post-orientation) is disqualifying (non-waivable). AFROTC is an extremely competitive environment and any illegal drug use will jeopardize your future career as an Air Force Officer. Cadets who are under 21 years old are strongly discouraged from drinking alcohol. If underage cadets are found guilty by school or civil authorities of underage drinking, those cadets will be counseled and may be processed for disenrollment or asked to leave the program.

The Air Force has a Zero Tolerance policy on illegal drug use or abuse in the cadet corps and on active duty. By signing the Drug Demand Reduction Program memorandum of understanding upon program entry, you are subject to random drug testing any time after program entry during the Academic Year or at Field Training.
