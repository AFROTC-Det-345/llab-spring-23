The OPLAN content is highly adjustable to what the detachment feels is necessary apart from the AFROTCI 36-2011 required items and the following:

  
**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

**CHAPTER 1 – GENERAL GUIDANCE**

**1.1.** **Situation.** HQ ROTC has directed Detachment 345 to execute Practical Military Training (PMT) in accordance with AFROTCI 36-2011, _Cadet Operations_ and AFROTC 36-2011 Volume 1, _Cadet’s Guide to Leadership Laboratory (LLAB) Curriculum, Academic Year 2022- 2023_ to recruit, train, and commission the world’s best Air Force and Space Force Second Lieutenants.  This directive establishes the mission, responsibilities, and Det 345 force structure.

**1.2.** **Mission.** The 345th Air Force ROTC Detachment Cadet Wing trains, educates, and motivates cadets to develop leadership and followership skills necessary to commission as Air Force and Space Force officers through the embodiment of core values, comprehension of doctrine, and esprit de corps.

**1.3.** **Vision.** Fostering a high performing and supportive environment that emphasizes mentorship, ownership, and attention to detail.

**1.4.** **Policies.** Outlined below are various Cadet Wing policies to be implemented throughout the Fall 2022 semester. The intention for these policies is to clearly covey expectations for the Cadet Wing as a whole, and to serve as a quick reference for all cadets.

**1.4.1.** IAW AFROTCI 36-2011 V3, para 9.10.1, “cadets and participating students must achieve at least 80% attendance over the course of the term to pass each of the following: AS Class, LLAB, and PT. All absences will initially be categorized as unexcused and will count against the 80% attendance requirement. At the discretion of the primary instructor, the absence may be marked as excused after the cadet completes missed objectives. Excused absences will count towards meeting the 80% attendance requirement.”

**1.4.1.1.** Attendance at mandatory Practical Military Training events is the expected norm. Absence is considered irregular and highly infrequent. Excusal from mandatory PMT will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the OFC.

**1.4.1.2.** Regular attendance is also expected for POC at events in addition to PMT. Such events may include, but are not limited to, weekly meetings for all POC that take place before and after PMT, Cadre meetings for members of CW leadership, and meetings for all POC following AS300 and AS400 class.

**1.4.2.** Detachment 345 has a zero-tolerance policy on sexual harassment and assault, drug abuse, underage drinking, mal-training, and discrimination of any kind. If a cadet would like to report on one of these issues, there are four courses of action one may take:

**1.4.2.1.** Follow their respective chain of command, informing their direct supervisor.

**1.4.2.2.** “Jump” their chain of command and inform their superior’s superior, or any other cadet higher in the chain of command or go directly to the Cadre.

**1.4.2.3.** Go directly to the Cadet Wing Inspector General.

**1.4.2.4.** Utilize the Commander’s Action Line.

**1.4.2.4.1.** The Commander’s Action Line is an anonymous reporting tool for issues of mal-training, mal-treatment, hazing, unprofessional relations, or any other serious concerns that are shared directly with the Detachment Commander. The form is For Official Use Only (FOUO) and can be accessed via the Detachment 345 Teams.

**1.4.3.** Cadets with exemplary Physical Fitness Assessment scores will be granted “PT Passes” on a sliding scale. The pass may be used at the cadet’s discretion to excuse them from one PT session without counting against their total attendance. The cadet must inform their chain of command NLT 24 hours prior to its use for proper accountability of all cadets. This number of passes is determined by following scale:

**1.4.3.1.** ≥ 95 PFA score grants one PT Pass

**1.4.3.2.** = 100 PFA score grants two PT Passes

**CHAPTER 2 – CADET WING ORGANIZATION**

**2.1.** **Organizational Structure.** The Cadet Wing structure is broken down into three distinct levels. Those being Group, Squadron, and Flight levels.

**Table 2.1. Unit Manning Document**

**Office Symbol** | **Office Title / Function** | **Rank** | **Name**


**2.2.** **Cadet Appointments and Rotation.** All POC cadets must serve in at least one leadership role throughout the semester. This will be accomplished through their cadet job, though the Professional Officer Course In Charge (POCIC) program can be utilized. The following cadet jobs classify as a leadership role in the Fall 2022 semester: CW/CC, CW/CV, CW/SPO, CW/IG, CW/DS, TRG/CC, MSG/CC, TRS/CC, CS/CC, LRS/CC, CW/PA, TFA/CC, TFB/CC, TRS/PFO, and TRG/XP.

**2.2.1.** There is a weekly rotation of FTP cadets to serve as the “FTP Flight Commander” in preparation for the rigors of Field Training. A different FTP cadet will be chosen each week. Every FTP cadet will serve as the “FTP Flight Commander” in the Fall 2022 semester.

**2.2.2.** GMC cadets without a specific position and corresponding office symbol will use the following office symbols for appropriate use on documents such as MFRs.

**2.2.2.1.** Cadets in Alpha Flight will use C/Rank FIRST MI. LAST/345 TRS/TFOA

**2.2.2.2.** Cadets in Bravo Flight will use C/Rank FIRST MI. LAST/345 TRS/TFOB

**2.2.3.** GMC cadets without a specific position and corresponding office symbol will use the following office title for appropriate use on documents and emails for their signature block.

**2.2.3.1.** Cadets in Alpha Flight will have the duty title of Alpha Flight Cadet.

**2.2.3.2.** Cadets in Bravo Flight will have the duty title of Bravo Flight Cadet.

**CHAPTER 3 – FORMS OF PRACTICAL MILITARY TRAINING**

**3.1.** **Mandatory Practical Military Training.** IAW AFROTCI 36-2011 V3, para 10.3.1.1, “Any AFROTC sponsored training activity designed to present training objectives IAW the current academic year’s AFROTCI 36-2011, VOL. 1. Mandatory PMT events include but are not limited to LLAB and PT and must be supervised, authorized, facilitated and/or provided resources by an authorized cadre member. A qualified cadre member must be present during all mandatory PMT scheduled activities and ensure all cadets are under the supervision of a qualified cadre member, to include qualified NCO cadre. The Det/CC and all APAS cadre members, to include APAS contractors, must be present for all LLAB events. The Det/CC may excuse individual cadre from LLAB events on a case-by-case basis.”

**Table 3.1. Fall 2022 PMT Overview & Projected Objectives**

*This plan is subject to change.  CAO 21 August 2022.

**3.1.1.** Leadership Laboratory is a cadet planned, organized, and executed training environment. LLAB goals are met through an implementation of a robust planning process that incorporates and accomplishes the objectives and samples of behavior as outlined in the AFROTCI 36-2011 V1. LLAB is conducted from 1530 to 1730 every Tuesday, with the potential of extension to 1830. The primary meeting locations consist of the University of Massachusetts Lowell East Campus Field, the Tsongas Center, or Wannalancit Mills Room 105. The meeting location, uniform of the day, and activity consistently change week to week. It is imperative that cadets refer to the Operations Order that is sent out each week for the most up to date information on LLAB.

**Table 3.1.1. Fall 2022 Expected Warrior Knowledge**

 *This document is subject to change.  CAO 21 August 2022.

**3.1.2.** Initial Military Training is a cadet planned, organized, and executed training environment. IMT goals are met through an implementation of a robust planning process that incorporates and accomplishes the objectives and samples of behavior as outlined in the AFROTCI 36-2011 V1. IMT is conducted from 1500 to 1555 every Friday, with the potential that it is held immediately following LLAB, from 1730 to 1830. The primary meeting locations consist of the University of Massachusetts Lowell East Campus Field, the Tsongas Center, or Wannalancit Mills Room 105. The meeting location, uniform of the day, and activity consistently change week to week. It is imperative that cadets refer to the Operations Order that is sent out each week for the most up to date information on IMT.

**3.1.2.1.** By the nature of Initial Military Training, the environment is meant to serve as one where IMT cadets can reinforce the knowledge presented in LLAB, while serving as additional practice to hone their skills and knowledge.

**3.1.3.** Field Training Preparation is a cadet planned, organized, and executed training environment. FTP goals are met through an implementation of a robust planning process that incorporates and accomplishes the objectives and samples of behavior as outlined in the AFROTCI 36-2011 V1. FTP is conducted from 1500 to 1555 every Friday, with the potential that it is held immediately following LLAB, from 1730 to 1830. The primary meeting locations consist of the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML) East Campus Field, the Tsongas Center, or Wannalancit Mills Room 105. The meeting location, uniform of the day, and activity consistently change week to week. It is imperative that cadets refer to the Operations Order that is sent out each week for the most up to date information on FTP.

**3.1.3.1.** By the nature of Field Training Preparation, cadets are expected to perform at a high level. FTP will serve as a higher intensity environment to reinforce the knowledge presented in LLAB, and FTP cadets will be under constant evaluation as their level of preparation for Field Training is determined.

**3.1.4.** Physical Training is an environment where cadets are trained in order to improve their overall health, and wellbeing. PT is conducted every Monday and Wednesday morning from 0630 to 0730, and Friday from 1610 to 1700. The primary meeting locations consist of the University of Massachusetts Lowell East Campus Field, or the University of Massachusetts Lowell Campus Recreation Center. Throughout the semester, two Physical Fitness Assessment will be administered IAW DAFMAN 36-2905. Cadets exhibiting substandard performance will be encouraged to reach out to the TRS/PFO or TRG/PFD.

**Table 3.1.4. Significant PT Dates & Semester PT Plan**

*This plan is subject to change.  CAO 9 August 2022.

**3.2.** **Voluntary Practical Military Training.** IAW AFROTCI 36-2011 V3, para 10.3.1.2, “Any AFROTC sponsored, military-related training activity that the Det/CC designates as voluntary PMT. Examples include but are not limited to mock deployments, FT preparation classes conducted in addition to normal LLAB hour requirements and drill team/honor guard membership. AFROTC may hold medical liability for voluntary PMT activities. Detachment commanders should use appropriate command authority and decision-making processes to determine cadre presence at voluntary PMT events.”

**3.2.1.** The Cadet Honor Guard Representatives are responsible for Honor Guard membership by developing and publicizing this critical outreach program. The Detachment 345 Honor Guard supports local organizations including UMass Lowell by providing details for special events. Membership requires training outside of PMT hours.

**3.2.2.** Extracurricular activities will be planned and executed throughout the semester. Possible activities include Cadet Wing morale events, community service events, incentive / orientation flights, 5K races, base visits, informative briefings, and recruiting events.

**3.3.** **Non-Practical Military Training.** IAW AFROTCI 36-2011 V3, para 10.4, “There are many activities cadets participate in that are not training and/or are not sponsored by the detachment or cadet wing. Non-PMT activities include those events that are neither part of the scheduled coursework, part of the curricular activities, nor within the definition of PMT, but have social, public relations, or educational value. Do not use class or LLAB time for non-PMT activities. Examples of Non-PMT activities include, but are not limited to Arnold Air Society, Silver Wings, booster club, and intramural sports activities.” “10.4.1. AFROTC holds no medical or legal liability for non-PMT activities.” “10.4.2. The detachment commander may prohibit uniform wear for non-PMT activities.”

**3.3.1.** Arnold Air Society is a professional, honorary service organization that supports the Cadet Wing, serves the community, and further develops officer candidates. Membership into the Detachment 345 Captain John A. Ogonowski Squadron requires a cadet to complete a rigorous training course. AAS members have the opportunity to apply for additional scholarships, internships, and summer training programs that non-members cannot.

**3.3.2.** Cadets are encouraged to participate in intramural sports with other members of the Cadet Wing. Because it is non-PMT, AFROTC does not hold liability for injuries that occur during intramural sports.

**3.3.3.** Studying in groups for tests such as the AFOQT must be limited to those who have not taken the test before. Please see the following references for more information: AFMAN 36-2664, para 4.12.5, and AFMAN 36-2664 AFCM2021-01, para 4.12.5.3.8.

**3.3.4.** Cadets are not authorized to fundraise with the appearance of any Air Force, Space Force, or AFROTC sponsorship. This includes fundraisers conducted by Arnold Air Society, Air Force Association, or any other organizations affiliated with Detachment 345. Please see the following references for more information: AFROTCI 36-2011 V3, para 1.6, and AFI 34-223 para 10.11.

**3.3.5.** While peaceful political activism is encouraged, cadets are not authorized to do so with the appearance of any Air Force or AFROTC sponsorship whether through social media or in-person events. Cadets are not to take part in demonstrations that result in violence on people or property. Participation in organizations promoting “extremist” ideology that encourage discrimination, hate, or harassment against others will not be tolerated. Please see the following reference for more information: AFI 51-508, para 2.4.1.17.

**3.4.** **Practical Military Training Policies.** Each cadet attends mandatory PMT activities that are AFROTC sponsored training. These activities are uniquely military, meet the requirements in Title 10 U.S.C. 2109, Practical Military Training, and Detachment Commander designates as PMT. For the Fall 2022 term, mandatory PMT will include weekly LLAB, three weekly PT sessions, and weekly IMT or FTP. IAW AFROTCI 36-2011 V3, para 10.3.4.4., cadets will attend no more than six (6) hours (Monday through Sunday) of mandatory PMT activities each week. Deviations from the mandatory PMT maximum time limits will be coordinated and approved by the Detachment 345 Commander in advance. There are many activities cadets participate in that are not training and/or are not sponsored by the Detachment or Cadet Wing. Cadet Wing meetings will be held on a weekly basis for cadets in leadership or staff positions.

**3.5.** **Practical Military Training Responsibilities.** The success of all PMT events relies solely on POC understanding the training objectives and supporting the instruction of such objectives. Prior to all PMT events, a CONOP will be created by TRG and distributed to all POC in attendance of the PMT event. The purpose of this CONOP is to ensure all POC understand their duties and responsibilities for the PMT event. The CONOP must include, but is not limited to, all objectives being certified, a timeline of the events and required materials. MSG will be required to ensure all materials are at the location of the PMT event as well as serviceable. TRG will be required to ensure all POC are adequately training the GMC, accomplishing all objectives for that day, and sticking to the timeline. Wing staff will be required to ensure all POC have a CONOP and to resolve any issues that may arise. All POC are required to attend LLAB. IMT and FTP both require at least three POC in attendance. Additionally, one of the following must be in attendance at both IMT and FTP: CW/CC, CW/CV, or TRG/CC.
